# Example: Serverless Search Portal with Globus Embeds

This repository is an example of the [@globus/template-search-portal](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal)

You can create your own portal with similar functionality by following the [**Creating Your Own Research Search Portal**](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-your-own-static-research-search-portal) section in the template repository and then referencing the sections below.

## Background

Metadata in a Globus Search often includes references to assets hosted on a Globus Connect Server. When the Globus Connect Server (and Collection) is configured to support [HTTPS Access](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-server/v5.4/https-access-collections/) these assets can be configured to be embedded in search results (e.g. "preview").

## Pre-Requisites

- A [Globus Search Index](https://docs.globus.org/api/search/) you administer.
- A Globus Collection that hosts data relevant to the documents in your Globus Search Index.
- A Search Portal, created following: [**Creating Your Own Research Search Portal**](https://github.com/globus/template-search-portal?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-your-own-static-research-search-portal) in our template repository, **with Authentication enabled.**
